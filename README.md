🔹 Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
The program prompts the user to enter two numbers.
It then performs four basic mathematical operations:
Addition of the two numbers.
Subtraction (first number minus second number).
Multiplication of the two numbers.
Division (first number divided by second number), with a check to avoid division by zero.
The results of all operations are displayed to the user.

🔹 Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting
The program asks the user to enter their first name and last name.
It combines the names into a full name.
A personalized greeting message is then printed using the full name (e.g., “Hello, John Doe! Welcome to the Python program.”).
