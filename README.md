🔹 Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
The program prompts the user to enter two numbers.
It then performs four basic mathematical operations:
Addition of the two numbers.
Subtraction (first number minus second number).
Multiplication of the two numbers.
Division (first number divided by second number), with a check to avoid division by zero.
The results of all operations are displayed to the user.

🔹 Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting
The program asks the user to enter their first name and last name.
It combines the names into a full name.
A personalized greeting message is then printed using the full name (e.g., “Hello, John Doe! Welcome to the Python program.”).

🔹 Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
This program asks the user to enter a whole number (an integer). It then checks whether the number is divisible by 2 using the modulus operator (%). If the remainder is 0, the number is 
even; otherwise, it is odd. The program then displays a message telling the user whether the number they entered is even or odd.

🔹 Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
This program calculates the total sum of all integers from 1 to 50. It uses a for loop to go through each number in that range, adding them together one by one. Once the loop finishes, 
the program prints the final sum, which is the result of adding all numbers from 1 to 50.
